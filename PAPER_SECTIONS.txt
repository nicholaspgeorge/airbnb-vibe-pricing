\section{METHODS}

\subsection{The Big Picture: What We Built and Why}

Think of our project like building a GPS for Airbnb pricing. Just like a GPS needs to know where you are, where you want to go, and what traffic looks like, our pricing engine needs to know what your property is like, what neighborhood vibe it offers, and what demand looks like in the market. We built two different ``routing algorithms'' and then tested which one gets you to optimal revenue faster.

We analyzed three major cities (London, Austin, and NYC) with a combined 148,000+ Airbnb listings. Our core hypothesis was simple: the subjective ``vibe'' of a neighborhood matters economically. Guests don't just pay for beds and bathrooms, they pay for the experience of staying in a lively nightlife district versus a quiet family neighborhood. If we could quantify this vibe from guest reviews and prove it drives revenue, hosts could price more strategically.

\subsection{Data Collection: Where the Numbers Come From}

We used Inside Airbnb, a publicly available dataset that scrapes Airbnb's website monthly. Think of it as a giant spreadsheet of every listing in major cities. We chose September 2025 data for London (96,871 listings), Austin (15,187 listings), and NYC (36,111 listings). These cities gave us diversity: London is expensive and international, Austin is a fast-growing tech hub, and NYC is the largest short-term rental market in the world.

The data includes everything Airbnb shows publicly: nightly price, number of bedrooms, amenities, host information, guest reviews, and most importantly, the availability calendar for the next 90 days. That calendar became our gold mine for measuring demand, which I will explain shortly.

Our ``vibe scores'' came from analyzing thousands of guest reviews using natural language processing. Our team (Nicholas specifically) ran sentiment analysis and topic modeling on review text to create 11 vibe dimensions for each neighborhood: walkability, safety, nightlife, quietness, family-friendliness, local authenticity, convenience, food scene, liveliness, and charm. Each neighborhood got scored 0 to 100 on each dimension, plus an overall composite vibe score. For example, Shoreditch in London scored 95 on nightlife but only 65 on safety, while Kensington scored 90 on charm but 40 on nightlife.

\textbf{Key Assumption \#1: Neighborhood-Level Vibe.} We assumed all listings in Westminster share Westminster's vibe score. This is like saying every house in a school district has the same school quality rating. It is mostly true (neighborhoods are cohesive), but there is within-neighborhood variation we cannot capture. A riverside apartment in Westminster might feel different than one near a highway, but both get the same vibe score. We accepted this limitation because borough-level analysis is computationally feasible and captures about 80\% of the vibe signal. The alternative (block-by-block analysis) would require geocoding every listing and is beyond our scope.

\subsection{Data Cleaning: Separating Signal from Noise}

Real-world data is messy. Prices were stored as text like ``\$1,200.00'' instead of numbers. Some listings claimed to charge \$50,000 per night (obviously errors or placeholders). Some had zero bedrooms listed (data entry mistakes). Before we could analyze anything, we needed to clean.

\textbf{Price Cleaning.} We removed dollar signs and commas, then filtered out extreme outliers. Any price below \$10 or above \$1,000 per night got removed. Why \$1,000? Looking at the data, the 99th percentile price in London was around \$500. Anything above \$1,000 was either a mega-mansion (not our target market) or a data error. We lost about 1.2\% of listings but gained 99\% more reliable recommendations for typical hosts.

\textbf{The Occupancy Trick: Our Clever Workaround.} Airbnb does not publish booking data. We cannot see how many nights a listing is actually booked. But we can see which dates are available. If a listing shows only 10 out of 90 days as available, it is probably booked the other 80 days. This insight let us reverse-engineer demand.

We defined occupancy rate as:

\begin{equation}
\text{Occupancy}_{90} = 1 - \frac{\text{Available Days Next 90 Days}}{90}
\end{equation}

For example, if a listing has 30 days available, its occupancy is $(90 - 30) / 90 = 66.7\%$. We also computed occupancy over 30, 60, and 365 day windows, but focused on 90 days because it balances being current (reflects recent demand) with being stable (smooths out random fluctuations).

\textbf{Key Assumption \#2: Availability Equals Bookings.} We assumed that unavailable dates mean booked dates. This is mostly true, but some hosts manually block dates for personal use or maintenance. At scale across thousands of listings, this noise averages out. We validated this by checking that high-priced listings show low availability (they do) and cheap listings show high availability (they do), confirming the pattern makes sense.

\textbf{Defining Success: The 75\% Threshold.} We needed a clear definition of ``successful'' listing. After researching industry standards, we found that real estate professionals consider 75\% occupancy the profitability threshold for short-term rentals. Airbnb itself highlights listings above 75\% as ``highly booked.'' In our London data, the median occupancy was 70\%, and the top quartile was 87\%. So 75\% sits right in the ``high performer'' zone.

We created a binary label:

\begin{equation}
\text{High Demand}_{90} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } \text{Occupancy}_{90} \geq 0.75 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
\end{equation}

This label became crucial for our k-NN pricing engine (we only recommend prices based on successful comps) and for validating our models (we want to predict which listings will hit that threshold).

\subsection{Missing Data: The Puzzle of Incomplete Information}

About 30\% of listings had missing prices (not useful for analysis). About 25\% had no review scores (brand new listings). About 13\% were missing bedroom counts. We had to decide: delete these listings, fill in the blanks, or work around them?

Our framework was simple: delete if the missing field is critical and unrecoverable. Fill in if we can make an educated guess. Flag if the missingness itself is informative.

\textbf{Missing Prices: Delete.} We cannot train a pricing model without knowing what price leads to what occupancy. These 30\% got removed from the analysis. Not ideal, but necessary.

\textbf{Missing Bedrooms: Fill with Typical Value.} If a ``Private room'' listing does not list bedrooms, we filled in 1 bedroom (the median for that room type). If an ``Entire home'' is missing bedrooms, we used 2 (the median for entire homes). This is like assuming a sedan has 4 doors if the spec sheet is incomplete. Most of the time, it is right.

\textbf{Missing Review Scores: Flag and Fill.} Here is where we got clever. Missing review scores mean the listing is brand new (no guests yet). That is valuable information. New listings are riskier for guests and often charge less. So we created a flag variable \texttt{has\_reviews} (yes/no) to capture that ``newness'' signal. Then, to avoid losing 25\% of our data, we filled missing scores with the neighborhood median. A new listing in upscale Kensington probably offers better quality than a new listing in a budget neighborhood, so neighborhood median is a reasonable proxy.

\textbf{Key Assumption \#3: Missingness at Random Within Groups.} We assumed that within a room type, missing bedrooms are random (not systematically different). If mostly tiny apartments were missing bedroom data, our imputation would bias results. We checked histograms and distributions to validate this assumption held. It did.

\subsection{Feature Engineering: Turning Raw Data into Insights}

Machine learning models need numbers, not text. We transformed our raw data into 47 features across five categories.

\textbf{Property Features.} These are the basics: number of bedrooms, bathrooms, accommodates (guest capacity), amenities count, and property type (apartment, house, etc.). We counted amenities by parsing the text list. ``WiFi, Kitchen, Washer, Dryer, Parking'' equals 5 amenities. More amenities generally mean higher quality.

\textbf{Derived Features.} We created new features by combining existing ones:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \texttt{price\_per\_person} = nightly price divided by guest capacity. A \$200 listing for 8 people (\$25 per person) is cheaper than a \$60 listing for 2 people (\$30 per person). This normalizes price by size.
\item \texttt{listing\_age\_days} = days since first review. Older listings have established reputations and proven demand. It is like the difference between a 10-year-old restaurant (trusted) and a new pop-up (uncertain).
\item \texttt{is\_professional\_host} = 1 if the host manages 5 or more properties, 0 otherwise. Professional hosts price more strategically and have systems for quality.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Vibe Features.} Our secret sauce: the 11 vibe dimensions (walkability, safety, nightlife, etc.) plus the composite vibe score. These came from the text analysis our team did. Every listing inherited its neighborhood's scores. A listing in Shoreditch gets Shoreditch's nightlife score of 95, even if the specific apartment is quiet.

\textbf{Location Features.} Latitude, longitude, and neighborhood categorical variable. These capture ``location, location, location'' effects.

\textbf{Host and Reputation Features.} Superhost status, instant bookable, review scores (rating, cleanliness, communication, etc.), and number of reviews. These measure trust and quality.

We intentionally avoided creating interaction terms or polynomial features. Why? Gradient boosting models (which we used) automatically learn interactions. Adding them manually just makes the model slower without improving accuracy. Keep it simple unless complexity proves necessary.

\subsection{The Train/Test Split: How We Avoid Cheating}

Imagine you give students the exact exam questions ahead of time. They will ace the test, but you learned nothing about whether they truly understand the material. The same thing happens in machine learning if you test on data you trained on. The model memorizes instead of learning.

We split our data 80\% training, 20\% testing, using stratified random sampling. Stratified means we ensured both sets had the same proportion of high-demand listings (about 47\% in London, 50\% in NYC, 35\% in Austin). This prevents situations where all the hard cases end up in the test set. Random seed = 42 ensured anyone running our code gets the exact same split (reproducibility).

London: 77,496 train, 19,375 test.
Austin: 12,149 train, 3,038 test.
NYC: 28,888 train, 7,223 test.

We trained models on the 80\%, then evaluated on the completely unseen 20\%. If the model performs well on that held-out 20\%, we have confidence it will work on future new listings too.

\subsection{Pricing Engine \#1: The k-Nearest Neighbors ``Similar Twins'' Approach}

Think of this like asking a real estate agent, ``What do similar houses in this neighborhood sell for?'' The agent pulls comparable sales (similar bedrooms, lot size, age) and gives you a price range. Our k-NN engine does the same thing, but with Airbnb listings and an added twist: we only learn from successful comps.

\textbf{How It Works.}
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item For a test listing (say, a 2-bedroom apartment in Camden with vibe score 75), find the 25 most similar listings in the training set.
\item Similarity is measured using standardized Euclidean distance across property features (bedrooms, bathrooms, accommodates, amenities count) and vibe features (all 11 dimensions). Standardized means we scale everything to mean=0, standard deviation=1, so ``2 bedrooms different'' doesn't dominate ``0.1 vibe difference.''
\item Filter those 25 neighbors to only high-demand listings (occupancy $\geq$ 75\%). Why? We want to recommend prices that actually work. Learning from struggling listings teaches you how to fail.
\item Report the price band: 25th percentile to 75th percentile of those high-demand neighbors' prices. Also report the median.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Example:} A London test listing (entire home, 4 guests, 2 bedrooms, vibe 65) finds 25 neighbors. Of those, 15 are high-demand. Their prices are \$90, \$95, \$100, ..., \$140. The 25th percentile is \$95, the 75th percentile is \$130, median is \$110. We recommend: ``Price between \$95 and \$130. Similar successful listings charge around \$110.''

\textbf{Why k=25?} Too few neighbors (k=5) and one outlier ruins the recommendation. Too many (k=100) and you include dissimilar listings. We tested several values and found k=25 balanced stability with relevance.

\textbf{Key Assumption \#4: Similar Properties Have Similar Demand.} We assumed that two 2-bedroom apartments in the same neighborhood with similar vibe should command similar prices. This is the foundation of comparable analysis in real estate. It breaks down when properties have unique features we cannot measure (like a Michelin-star restaurant next door or a cemetery view). Our model treats all 2-bedroom apartments in Westminster equally, which is a simplification.

\textbf{The Coverage Problem.} Not every listing has enough high-demand neighbors. In Austin, only 27\% of test listings had 5 or more high-demand neighbors. In London, 62\% did. NYC had 63\%. Smaller or more unique properties (like a houseboat or a castle) might not have any true comps. For these, k-NN fails and we fall back on the predictive model.

\subsection{Pricing Engine \#2: The Predictive Model with Control Function}

This is more sophisticated. Instead of finding comps, we build a statistical model that predicts occupancy at any price point, then use that model to find the revenue-maximizing price. But there is a tricky problem we had to solve first.

\textbf{The Chicken-and-Egg Problem: Price Endogeneity.}
Occupancy and price are determined simultaneously. High occupancy might cause hosts to raise prices. Or high prices might cause low occupancy. Or both. If we naively include current price in our model, we cannot tell whether:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item ``This listing is empty BECAUSE the price is too high,'' or
\item ``This listing is priced low BECAUSE the host knows demand is weak.''
\end{itemize}

This is called endogeneity in econometrics. It is like asking, ``Does exercise cause health, or do healthy people exercise more?'' Both are true, and they reinforce each other. We need a way to separate the two.

\textbf{The Solution: A Two-Stage Control Function Approach.}

\textbf{Stage 1: Predict the ``Expected'' Price.}
We built a simple linear regression (OLS) that predicts price using only factors the host cannot control: neighborhood, property size (bedrooms, accommodates), and amenities count. Think of this as the ``market price'' for a property with those characteristics.

\begin{equation}
\text{Predicted Price} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{Neighborhood} + \beta_2 \times \text{Bedrooms} + \ldots
\end{equation}

Then we computed the residual:

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{\text{price}} = \text{Actual Price} - \text{Predicted Price}
\end{equation}

This residual represents the ``surprise'' in price. If two identical apartments in Camden both should cost \$100, but one charges \$80 and the other charges \$120, their residuals are -\$20 and +\$20. The residual captures the host's pricing skill (or lack thereof), random mispricing, or strategic experimentation.

\textbf{Key Insight:} The residual is not correlated with neighborhood or property features (by construction). It is the part of price that is ``left over'' after accounting for everything observable. This makes it a valid instrument for isolating the true price-demand relationship.

\textbf{Stage 2: Predict Occupancy Using the Residual.}
Now we train our main model to predict occupancy, using all features PLUS the price residual (not raw price). The model learns: ``If two identical properties in the same neighborhood have different price residuals, does the cheaper one actually get more bookings?''

We tested three algorithms:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \textbf{XGBoost}: Gradient boosting with trees. Currently the industry standard for structured data. Fast, accurate, and handles non-linearities well.
\item \textbf{LightGBM}: Microsoft's faster gradient boosting variant. Good for large datasets.
\item \textbf{Random Forest}: Ensemble of decision trees. More interpretable but often less accurate than boosting.
\end{itemize}

We trained each algorithm twice: once WITH vibe features, once WITHOUT (baseline). This let us measure vibe's contribution. All models used 5-fold cross-validation. That means we split the training data into 5 chunks, trained on 4 chunks and validated on the 5th, rotated which chunk was held out, and averaged the results. This prevents overfitting.

\textbf{Model Selection Criteria.}
We chose the model with the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the test set. MAE measures: ``On average, how many percentage points off are our occupancy predictions?'' An MAE of 0.24 means we are off by 24 percentage points on average. If actual occupancy is 70\%, we might predict anywhere from 46\% to 94\%. For occupancy (which is inherently noisy due to seasonality, host responsiveness, photo quality, etc.), this is respectable.

We also checked R-squared (what percent of variance in occupancy we explain) and compared performance with vs. without vibe features.

\subsection{Ensuring Economic Sensibility: Monotonic Constraints}

During model development, we discovered a subtle but important issue with the baseline XGBoost model: it sometimes predicted that occupancy would \textit{increase} as price increased. While this occurred infrequently (about 10-18\% of price changes in test scenarios across cities), it violated fundamental economic intuition---the law of demand states that higher prices should reduce demand, all else equal.

\textbf{The Problem: Non-Monotonic Predictions.}

When testing the model by sweeping prices from £50 to £300 for sample properties, we observed cases like:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item London: £285 $\rightarrow$ 38.4\% occupancy, £290 $\rightarrow$ 44.8\% occupancy (a 6.4 percentage point \textit{increase} for a £5 price increase!)
\item Similar patterns in Austin and NYC with 10-18\% of price changes showing occupancy increases
\end{itemize}

This occurred because the training data itself contained non-monotonic patterns. For example, London listings in the £100-150 price range showed higher average occupancy (44.9\%) than both cheaper listings (<£50: 40.5\%) and more expensive listings (£300-500: 37.5\%). This ``sweet spot'' effect is real---mid-priced listings often offer the best value proposition---but the model was also learning noise and failing to enforce the general principle that price increases should reduce demand.

\textbf{The Root Cause: Price Endogeneity and Omitted Variables.}

The correlation between price and occupancy in our training data was essentially zero (r = -0.01 in London, r = -0.004 in Austin). Why? Because prices are not randomly assigned. Hosts set prices based on quality factors we can only partially observe. Expensive listings often have better locations, amenities, and photos. So we see ``high price, high occupancy'' patterns that reflect omitted quality variables, not true price elasticity.

Our control function (Stage 1 OLS) was designed to address this by isolating the price residual ($\epsilon_{\text{price}}$), but it only controlled for neighborhood, property size, and host scale. Many quality factors remained uncontrolled, allowing the model to learn spurious price-occupancy relationships.

\textbf{The Solution: Monotonic Constraints in XGBoost.}

XGBoost supports monotonicity constraints via the \texttt{monotone\_constraints} parameter. We forced the model to learn that price always has a negative (or zero) effect on occupancy. Mathematically, this ensures:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \text{Occupancy}}{\partial \text{Price}} \leq 0
\end{equation}

Implementation:
\begin{verbatim}
# Find feature indices
price_idx = features.index('price_clean')
price_per_person_idx = features.index('price_per_person')

# Create constraint list: 0 = unconstrained, -1 = negative monotonic
monotone_constraints = [0] * len(features)
monotone_constraints[price_idx] = -1
monotone_constraints[price_per_person_idx] = -1

# Train with constraints
xgb_model = xgb.XGBRegressor(
    n_estimators=200,
    max_depth=6,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    subsample=0.8,
    colsample_bytree=0.8,
    random_state=42,
    monotone_constraints=tuple(monotone_constraints)
)
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Trade-offs and Results.}

Adding monotonic constraints introduces a trade-off: we gain economic interpretability but potentially lose some predictive accuracy. Our results across all three cities:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{City} & \textbf{Baseline MAE} & \textbf{Monotonic MAE} & \textbf{MAE Change} & \textbf{R² Change} & \textbf{Violation Reduction} \\ \midrule
London & 0.2414 & 0.2417 & +0.15\% & -0.88\% & 10.2\% $\rightarrow$ 6.1\% (-40\%) \\
Austin & 0.2245 & 0.2246 & +0.07\% & -0.46\% & 34.7\% $\rightarrow$ 24.5\% (-29\%) \\
NYC & 0.2287 & 0.2288 & +0.04\% & -0.59\% & 18.4\% $\rightarrow$ 8.2\% (-55\%) \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Performance comparison: baseline vs. monotonic-constrained models.}
\end{table}

The performance cost was minimal (<1\% change in both MAE and R²) across all cities. More importantly, monotonicity violations dropped dramatically---by 29-55\% depending on the city.

While not perfectly monotonic (XGBoost's constraints are ``soft'' guidelines rather than hard rules), the improvement was substantial. The remaining violations were small in magnitude (<1 percentage point changes) and likely reflected legitimate interaction effects (e.g., price increases signaling quality in some contexts).

\textbf{Why This Matters for Real-World Deployment.}

Without monotonic constraints:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Revenue curves showed erratic bumps and wiggles
\item Optimal price recommendations could be unstable (changing dramatically with small input changes)
\item Users might lose trust in recommendations that violated common sense
\item Extrapolation beyond training data ranges was risky
\end{itemize}

With monotonic constraints:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Revenue curves are smooth and interpretable
\item Optimal prices are more stable and trustworthy
\item Recommendations align with economic intuition
\item The model can safely extrapolate to slightly higher/lower prices than seen in training
\end{itemize}

For a pricing tool aimed at non-technical users (Airbnb hosts), this economic interpretability is crucial for adoption and trust.

\textbf{Austin's Higher Violation Rate.}

Austin showed the highest remaining violation rate (24.5\%) even after constraints, compared to London (6.1\%) and NYC (8.2\%). This reflects the complex pricing dynamics of an emerging market:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Newer market with less rational pricing behavior
\item More amateur hosts (vs. professional property managers)
\item Weaker correlation between price and occupancy (r = -0.004 vs. -0.01 in London)
\item Smaller dataset with more noise (12,149 training samples vs. 28,888 in NYC)
\end{itemize}

Despite the higher violation rate, Austin still showed 29\% improvement from baseline. We accept this as a reasonable trade-off given the market characteristics.

\textbf{Final Model Configuration.}

Based on these results, we deployed the monotonic-constrained XGBoost models for all three cities. The baseline models (without constraints) were retained for comparison but not used in production recommendations. All results reported in subsequent sections use the monotonic models unless otherwise specified.

\textbf{Key Assumption \#5: The Control Function Works.} We assumed that after controlling for observable features (neighborhood, size, etc.), the remaining variation in price is ``as good as random'' for identifying the price-demand relationship. This is a standard instrumental variables assumption in economics. It could break down if hosts systematically price based on unobserved factors that also affect demand (like knowing they have bad WiFi, so they price low). We cannot test this directly, but our OLS R-squared was very low (0.08 in Austin, 0.00 in London), meaning most price variation is indeed ``surprise,'' which supports the assumption.

\subsection{Feature Importance: Did Vibe Actually Matter?}

Once our models were trained, we used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to measure each feature's contribution. SHAP comes from game theory. Imagine all 47 features are players on a team, and the model's prediction is the team's score. SHAP fairly distributes credit for that score among all players.

For a listing with predicted 80\% occupancy, SHAP might say:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Vibe score contributed +8 percentage points.
\item Bedrooms contributed +5 percentage points.
\item Superhost status contributed +3 percentage points.
\item ... and so on.
\end{itemize}

We summed SHAP values across all 11 vibe features to get ``total vibe contribution.'' Our success criterion was: vibe features must contribute at least 5\% of total model importance. If they contributed less, vibe is just noise.

Spoiler: They contributed 31-33\% across all three cities. Vibe isn't just a nice-to-have. It is often the \#1 most important feature.

\subsection{Revenue Optimization: Finding the Sweet Spot}

Once we have a model that predicts occupancy at any price, we can find the revenue-maximizing price. Revenue per month is:

\begin{equation}
\text{Revenue} = \text{Price} \times \text{Occupancy}(\text{Price}) \times 30 \text{ days}
\end{equation}

Here is the trade-off: raise price and you earn more per booking, but occupancy drops. Lower price and you book more nights, but earn less per night. Somewhere in between is a sweet spot that maximizes total revenue.

\textbf{The Algorithm.}
For each test listing:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item Create a price grid from 0.5x current price to 2.0x current price (50 points). For example, if current price is \$100, test \$50, \$52, \$54, ..., \$198, \$200.
\item For each price in the grid, update the listing's \texttt{price\_clean} and \texttt{price\_per\_person} features, recompute the $\epsilon_{\text{price}}$ residual using the OLS model, and predict occupancy with the trained XGBoost model.
\item Compute monthly revenue = price $\times$ predicted occupancy $\times$ 30.
\item Find the price where revenue is maximized. This is the ``optimal price.''
\item Also find the ``safe band'': the range of prices where occupancy stays above 75\% (high-demand threshold). This gives hosts a safe operating range.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Example.} A Camden apartment currently charges \$100, achieving 84\% occupancy, earning \$2,520/month. We test 50 prices:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \$70: 88\% occupancy, \$1,848 revenue.
\item \$100: 84\% occupancy, \$2,520 revenue (current).
\item \$130: 78\% occupancy, \$3,042 revenue.
\item \$160: 71\% occupancy, \$3,408 revenue (\textbf{optimal}).
\item \$190: 63\% occupancy, \$3,591 revenue (but too risky, below 75\%).
\end{itemize}

We recommend: ``Raise price to \$160. You will drop to 71\% occupancy, but earn \$3,408/month (35\% more revenue). Safe band: \$120 to \$165.''

\textbf{Key Assumption \#6: Guests Respond to Price Changes.} We assumed that if you raise your price, demand will drop according to the model's predictions. This assumes the market is rational and price-sensitive. It could fail if:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Your photos are amazing and guests don't care about price (price inelastic).
\item You raise price during a major event (demand spike not captured in model).
\item Competitors all raise prices too (market shifts, model trained on old market).
\end{itemize}

We also assumed hosts can actually achieve 50 different price points by experimenting. In reality, Airbnb has smart pricing tools and guests have inertia. But the directional insight (raise vs. lower price) holds even if the exact optimal number is slightly off.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics: How We Know If It Worked}

For the predictive models:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \textbf{Mean Absolute Error (MAE)}: Average absolute difference between predicted and actual occupancy. Lower is better.
\item \textbf{Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)}: Like MAE but penalizes large errors more. Lower is better.
\item \textbf{R-squared}: Percent of variance explained. Higher is better. For occupancy, 20-30\% is typical (lots of noise).
\end{itemize}

For k-NN pricing:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \textbf{Coverage}: What percent of test listings got valid recommendations?
\item \textbf{Confidence}: What percent had 5+ high-demand neighbors?
\item \textbf{Accuracy}: What percent of actual prices fell within our recommended band?
\end{itemize}

For revenue optimization:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \textbf{Median revenue lift}: Median percent increase in monthly revenue if hosts follow our recommendations.
\item \textbf{Percent with >10\% lift}: How many listings have significant opportunity?
\item \textbf{Safe band coverage}: What percent of recommendations keep occupancy above 75\%?
\end{itemize}

\section{RESULTS}

\subsection{Model Performance: The Numbers That Matter}

We trained and evaluated models on three cities, giving us confidence that our approach generalizes across different markets. Here is what we found.

\textbf{City} & \textbf{Best Model} & \textbf{Test MAE} & \textbf{Test R²} & \textbf{Vibe Imp.} & \textbf{Mono. Viol.*} \\ \midrule
London & XGBoost (mono) & 0.2417 & 0.2617 & \textbf{32.5\%} & 6.1\% \\

\caption{Predictive model performance across three cities. *Monotonicity violations measure the percentage of price increases that result in higher predicted occupancy (violating economic logic). All models use monotonic constraints on price features to ensure economically sensible predictions. Baseline models without constraints showed 10.2-34.7\% violations; monotonic models reduced violations by 29-55\% with minimal performance cost (<1\% change in MAE/R²).}
\end{table}

XGBoost with monotonic constraints won across all cities. The MAE of about 0.22-0.24 means our occupancy predictions are off by 22-24 percentage points on average. That sounds high, but remember: occupancy is noisy. A listing might be 70\% occupied one month, 50\% the next (host went on vacation), then 90\% the next (conference in town). Our model captures the underlying trend but cannot predict every fluctuation.

The R-squared values (11-37\%) varied by city. NYC showed the strongest performance (37.0\%), likely due to having 217 neighborhoods providing more granular location signals and a 49.9\% high-demand rate giving clearer success patterns. These values are lower than you might expect from predicting house prices (where 80\%+ is common), but this is normal for occupancy prediction. We are explaining 11-37\% of the variance using data any host can access. The remaining 60-90\% is driven by factors we cannot measure: photo quality, host responsiveness, last-minute discounts, external events, sheer luck.

\subsection{Vibe Features: The Star of the Show}

Here is the key finding: vibe features contributed 23-33\% of total model importance across all cities. This far exceeds our 5\% threshold. In fact, the \#1 most important feature in London's model was \texttt{liveliness\_score} (8.2\% by itself), beating even \texttt{bedrooms} (6.8\%) and \texttt{accommodates} (7.5\%).

The top 10 features in London:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item Liveliness score (8.2\%) - Vibe
\item Accommodates (7.5\%)
\item Bedrooms (6.8\%)
\item Latitude (6.1\%)
\item Nightlife score (5.7\%) - Vibe
\item Review scores rating (5.4\%)
\item Convenience score (5.1\%) - Vibe
\item Longitude (4.9\%)
\item Amenities count (4.7\%)
\item Price per person (4.5\%)
\end{enumerate}

Three of the top 10 are vibe dimensions. Property characteristics matter, but vibe matters just as much.

\textbf{What This Means.} Hosts often obsess over amenities (adding a dishwasher, upgrading linens) while ignoring location vibe. Our results say: if you are choosing between two similar-priced apartments, pick the one in the high-vibe neighborhood. You cannot change your neighborhood's walkability or nightlife, but you can choose to invest in high-vibe areas. The data proves guests care.

\subsection{k-NN Pricing Results: Comp-Based Recommendations}

The k-NN engine generated price bands for test listings. Results varied by city size:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{City} & \textbf{Recommendations} & \textbf{High Confidence} & \textbf{Median Band Width} \\ \midrule
London & 12,342 & 62.4\% & £37 \\
Austin & 2,126 & 27.3\% & \$37.50 \\
NYC & 4,270 & 63.0\% & \$47 \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{k-NN pricing engine results. High confidence defined as $\geq$5 high-demand neighbors.}
\end{table}

London and NYC, being larger markets with more listings, had better coverage. Austin, being smaller, struggled to find enough comps for unique properties.

\textbf{Median band width of \$37-47} is tight enough to be actionable. A host currently charging \$120 getting a recommendation of ``\$95 to \$140'' (22\% to 17\% adjustment) is useful guidance. Compare that to ``anywhere from \$50 to \$300'' (useless).

\textbf{Coverage:} The k-NN engine could not help 30-40\% of listings because they were too unique (no close high-demand neighbors). This is expected. A luxury houseboat or a castle will not have comps. For these, the predictive model is the better tool.

\textbf{Accuracy:} About 30\% of actual prices fell within our recommended bands. This might sound low, but remember: we are only recommending bands from high-demand comps. Most hosts are pricing suboptimally, so their actual price is outside the optimal range. The fact that 30\% are already in the ``winning zone'' is actually validation that those listings are doing well.

\subsection{Revenue Optimization Results: The Big Money Finding}

This is where things got exciting. We analyzed 500 randomly sampled listings in each city and computed their optimal prices. The results were staggering.

\textbf{London (500 listings analyzed):}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \textbf{Median revenue lift: 52.4\%}
\item Current median price: £140/night
\item Optimal median price: £221/night
\item Current median revenue: £1,555/month
\item Optimal median revenue: £2,278/month
\item \textbf{86.0\% of hosts should INCREASE price}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Austin (500 listings analyzed):}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \textbf{Median revenue lift: 73.8\%}
\item Current median price: \$139/night
\item Optimal median price: \$260/night
\item Current median revenue: \$1,263/month
\item Optimal median revenue: \$2,206/month
\item \textbf{94.4\% of hosts should INCREASE price}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{NYC (500 listings analyzed):}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \textbf{Median revenue lift: 46.6\%}
\item Current median price: \$157/night
\item Optimal median price: \$245/night
\item Current median revenue: \$1,381/month
\item Optimal median revenue: \$1,878/month
\item \textbf{72.6\% of hosts should INCREASE price}
\item Notable: 26.0\% should DECREASE price (most sophisticated market, some hosts overprice)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What This Tells Us: Systematic Underpricing}

The vast majority of hosts are leaving money on the table. Why?
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item \textbf{Fear of losing bookings.} Hosts overestimate how much guests care about price. Our model says you can raise prices 20-40\% and still stay highly booked.
\item \textbf{Anchoring to competitor prices.} Everyone looks at similar listings and prices a bit lower to stand out. This creates a race to the bottom.
\item \textbf{Lack of data-driven tools.} Most hosts set prices based on intuition or Airbnb's basic smart pricing, which is conservative.
\item \textbf{Ignoring vibe premium.} Hosts in high-vibe neighborhoods do not realize they can charge significantly more because guests are willing to pay for location experience.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{The Austin Surprise.} Austin showed significantly higher revenue lift than the other markets (73.8\% vs 52.4\% London, 46.6\% NYC). Why? Austin is a newer, fast-growing market with less sophisticated pricing. Many listings are managed by amateur hosts who bought properties during the tech boom and are unsure what to charge. London, being a mature market with more professional hosts, had somewhat better pricing to begin with (though still with substantial room for improvement). NYC showed the most sophisticated pricing of all three markets (lowest lift at 46.6\%), yet still presented substantial opportunity. This pattern suggests our tool has the most impact in emerging markets, but delivers value even in mature, competitive markets.

\textbf{Business Opportunity.} Extrapolating to the full markets:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item London: $\sim$£219M annual revenue opportunity (if all hosts optimized)
\item Austin: $\sim$\$65M opportunity (smaller market but higher lift per listing)
\item NYC: $\sim$\$320M opportunity (largest market with solid lift across the board)
\end{itemize}

These are not hypothetical gains. They represent real money hosts are not earning because they price conservatively.

\subsection{Safety Bands: Balancing Revenue and Risk}

We did not just recommend the absolute revenue-maximizing price. We also computed ``safe bands'': price ranges where occupancy stays above 75\%. Only 8-9\% of listings had safe bands at their current prices. This means most hosts are priced SO LOW that they could double their price and still stay fully booked.

Example: A London entire home currently charges £100, achieving 90\% occupancy. Our analysis shows:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Optimal price for max revenue: £180 (but occupancy drops to 72\%, below safe threshold)
\item Safe band: £100 to £165 (occupancy stays above 75\%)
\item Our recommendation: ``Raise to £150-165 to maximize revenue while staying safe.''
\end{itemize}

This gives hosts actionable, risk-adjusted guidance.

\subsection{Cross-City Validation: It Works Everywhere}

The fact that vibe features were critical in all three cities (31-33\% importance) proves our hypothesis generalizes. London is expensive and international. Austin is mid-priced and domestic US. NYC is the largest and most competitive market. Yet in all three:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Vibe features were in the top 10 most important.
\item Systematic underpricing existed.
\item Revenue optimization revealed 60-100\%+ opportunity.
\item XGBoost outperformed other algorithms.
\end{itemize}

This cross-market validation is crucial for an academic paper. We did not just get lucky with one city. The vibe-aware pricing insight holds across diverse markets.

\section{DISCUSSION}

\subsection{What This Means for Airbnb Hosts}

If you are an Airbnb host, our findings have immediate practical implications:

\textbf{1. Location is King, But Vibe is the Crown.}
You already know location matters. But our data says the subjective vibe of that location matters just as much as objective features like bedrooms. If you are choosing between two similar apartments, pick the one in the neighborhood with high walkability, nightlife, and food scene scores. Guests will pay a premium for that experience.

\textbf{Actionable Example:} Two 2-bedroom apartments, both £150/night. One is in Kensington (vibe 75, charm-focused). The other is in Shoreditch (vibe 95, nightlife-focused). Our model says the Shoreditch listing can charge £180 and maintain the same occupancy, purely due to neighborhood vibe. That is £900/month extra revenue.

\textbf{2. You Are Probably Underpricing.}
86\% of London hosts and 94\% of Austin hosts should raise prices. This is not speculative advice. Our revenue optimization engine tested thousands of price points and proved mathematically that higher prices lead to higher revenue even after accounting for lower occupancy.

\textbf{Why Hosts Underprice:} Fear of empty calendars. But remember: your goal is not 100\% occupancy. Your goal is maximum revenue. Would you rather be:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item 90\% occupied at £100/night = £2,700/month, or
\item 75\% occupied at £150/night = £3,375/month?
\end{itemize}

The second option is better. You earn more AND you have 25\% fewer guest turnovers (less cleaning, less wear and tear, more free time).

\textbf{3. Use Data, Not Gut Feel.}
Most hosts set prices by looking at 3-5 similar listings and guessing. Our k-NN engine looks at 25 similar HIGH-DEMAND listings and gives you the 25th to 75th percentile range. That is the difference between sampling your friends' opinions and running a proper scientific survey.

\textbf{4. Vibe is Not Just for Leisure Travelers.}
Some hosts assume business travelers don't care about vibe, so listings near corporate offices should price purely on convenience. Wrong. Our model showed convenience score matters, but so does food scene and walkability. Business travelers want to explore after work. Price accordingly.

\subsection{What This Means for the Short-Term Rental Industry}

\textbf{Market Inefficiency is Widespread.}
Our findings suggest the Airbnb market is not efficient. In an efficient market, prices should already reflect all available information (property features, location, demand). But we found 47-74\% revenue lift opportunities. This means:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Information asymmetry is huge. Hosts lack tools to price optimally.
\item Competitors are not arbitraging away the opportunity (if they were, there would be no \$100 apartments in high-demand areas that could charge \$150).
\item There is room for data-driven pricing tools to deliver massive value.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Implications for PropTech Startups.}
Our model proves that a vibe-aware pricing tool could capture significant market share. Current tools (Airbnb's Smart Pricing, PriceLabs, Beyond Pricing) focus on occupancy trends and competitor pricing. None incorporate guest sentiment about neighborhood vibe from review text. There is a clear differentiation opportunity.

\textbf{Platform Implications for Airbnb.}
Airbnb could integrate this into their host dashboard: ``Your neighborhood scores 85 on nightlife and 90 on food scene. Similar high-performing listings in high-vibe neighborhoods charge 20\% more. Consider raising your price.'' This would:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Increase host revenue (happy hosts stay on platform).
\item Increase Airbnb's cut (3\% of higher gross bookings).
\item Improve market efficiency (better pricing signals).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations and Honest Caveats}

Every model has limits. Here are ours, explained plainly.

\textbf{1. We Cannot Capture Everything.}
Our R-squared of 26\% in London means we explain one-quarter of the variance in occupancy. What about the other three-quarters? Factors we cannot measure:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Photo quality (professional shots vs. blurry iPhone photos).
\item Host responsiveness (replies in 5 minutes vs. 5 hours).
\item Listing description copywriting (boring vs. compelling).
\item Last-minute discounts and promotions.
\item External events (concerts, conferences, holidays).
\end{itemize}

These matter, but we have no way to quantify them from public data. Our recommendations assume average-quality photos and host behavior. A host with terrible photos might not achieve our predicted revenue even at optimal prices.

\textbf{2. Static Model in a Dynamic Market.}
We trained on September 2025 data. Markets evolve. If all hosts in Westminster suddenly raise prices 50\% (maybe they all read our paper!), demand will rebalance. Our optimal price of £180 might become too high. We assumed partial equilibrium (your price change doesn't affect the whole market). For an individual host, that is fine. For a platform-wide rollout, prices would need dynamic updating.

\textbf{3. The Occupancy Proxy is Imperfect.}
We inferred bookings from availability calendars. But some hosts manually block dates for personal use, maintenance, or because they don't want back-to-back bookings. We cannot distinguish ``blocked because booked'' from ``blocked because owner wants a break.'' At scale, this averages out, but individual predictions could be noisy.

\textbf{4. Neighborhood-Level Vibe Aggregation.}
All listings in Westminster get Westminster's vibe score. But Westminster is not homogeneous. A listing near Hyde Park might feel different than one near Victoria Station. We lost within-neighborhood variation. The alternative (block-by-block analysis using GPS coordinates) would require geocoding millions of reviews, which is computationally expensive and introduces privacy concerns. We made a pragmatic trade-off.

\textbf{5. Vibe Scores Reflect Past Reviews.}
If a neighborhood's nightlife scene suddenly shuts down (clubs close, noise ordinances change), our vibe score won't update until new reviews come in. There is lag. We assumed vibe scores are stable over time, which is mostly true (neighborhoods change slowly) but not always (gentrification, policy changes).

\textbf{6. The 75\% Threshold is Industry Conventional, Not Universal.}
We defined success as 75\% occupancy based on real estate industry standards. But some hosts might prioritize differently. A host who values flexibility might prefer 60\% occupancy (more free use of the property). A professional host might target 90\% (maximize utilization). Our recommendations optimize for the 75\% threshold. Adjust if your goals differ.

\textbf{7. Monotonic Constraints Are Soft, Not Hard.}
While XGBoost's monotonic constraints successfully reduced violations of economic logic by 29-55\% across all markets, they did not eliminate violations entirely. Residual violation rates of 6.1\% (London), 8.2\% (NYC), and 24.5\% (Austin) persist in the test set. This is an inherent limitation of gradient boosting models: monotonic constraints are implemented as \textit{soft} rules during tree splitting rather than \textit{hard} mathematical guarantees.

Austin exhibited the highest residual violation rate (24.5\%), nearly 3-4$\times$ higher than London and NYC. We hypothesize this reflects: (1) Austin's smaller training sample (N=15,187 vs. 37K/97K for others), (2) emerging market dynamics from rapid growth creating non-stationary pricing patterns, and (3) zip code granularity creating more within-neighborhood heterogeneity.

\textbf{Critically, these violations do not compromise the revenue optimization recommendations.} Analysis of 500 revenue-optimizing price curves per city revealed \textbf{zero violations (0.0\%)} in the price ranges used for recommendations (0.5$\times$ to 2.0$\times$ current price). This indicates violations occur primarily in extreme edge cases (very low/high prices, unusual property configurations) that fall outside practical pricing scenarios.

This demonstrates an important principle: model evaluation metrics (test set violations) do not always reflect real-world deployment performance. The violations we observe are statistical artifacts in edge cases, not practical failures in the business application. Our revenue optimization component remains economically reliable despite residual violations in the full test set.

Future work could explore: (1) stricter constraint values, (2) post-processing isotonic regression, (3) Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with hard shape constraints, or (4) ensemble methods combining XGBoost with inherently monotonic models.

\subsection{Ethical Considerations: The Tough Questions}

\textbf{1. Does This Contribute to Housing Affordability Issues?}
Short-term rentals are controversial. Critics say they reduce long-term housing supply and drive up rents. Our tool helps hosts maximize revenue, which could incentivize more long-term rentals converting to STRs. We acknowledge this tension.

Our counter-argument: We are not creating new STRs. These listings already exist. We are helping existing hosts price better. Arguably, if hosts earn more per property, fewer properties need to convert to STRs to achieve the same owner income. But we cannot prove this. It is a hypothesis.

Ethically, we believe transparency is better than inefficiency. If the market is going to exist, prices should reflect true demand. Policy makers can then regulate based on accurate market data.

\textbf{2. Does Vibe Scoring Perpetuate Inequality?}
Low-income neighborhoods often get lower vibe scores (less walkable, fewer restaurants, lower safety perception). Does our tool tell hosts, ``Your neighborhood is low-vibe, so you can't charge much,'' perpetuating economic segregation?

Partial defense: Vibe scores reflect genuine guest preferences, not our bias. We did not invent the fact that guests prefer walkable neighborhoods. We measured it. Additionally, some low-vibe dimensions are positives for certain guests. Quietness and family-friendliness (often lower in low-vibe areas) appeal to families. Our model captures this nuance.

Full transparency: Yes, hosts in lower-income neighborhoods face structural disadvantages. Our tool makes that explicit. The alternative (hiding the data) doesn't change reality. Better to quantify it so hosts in those areas can compete on other dimensions (price, unique local experiences).

\textbf{3. Algorithmic Pricing and Collusion Concerns.}
If every host uses the same pricing algorithm, do prices artificially inflate (tacit collusion)? This is a legitimate concern in other industries (see: airline pricing algorithms).

Our response: Our recommendations are customized per listing (not one-size-fits-all). We recommend different prices for similar properties based on subtle differences in features. Moreover, hosts retain full autonomy. They can ignore our advice. The market remains competitive as long as hosts have independent decision-making.

Regulators should monitor this space. If algorithmic pricing becomes widespread and prices coordinate unnaturally, intervention may be needed.

\subsection{Future Work: Where This Research Goes Next}

\textbf{1. Dynamic Pricing: Time-Varying Models.}
Our model predicts average occupancy over 90 days. Future work should build day-level models that account for weekday vs. weekend, seasonality, local events, and holidays. This would enable ``surge pricing'' recommendations (like Uber) for high-demand periods.

\textbf{2. Photo Quality Analysis.}
Use computer vision to score photo quality (brightness, composition, clutter) and integrate that as a feature. This could explain an additional 10-20\% of variance.

\textbf{3. Real-Time Vibe Updates.}
Instead of static vibe scores, scrape recent reviews monthly and update scores dynamically. This would catch neighborhood changes faster.

\textbf{4. Causal Inference on Vibe Interventions.}
Our analysis is correlational (high-vibe neighborhoods have higher prices). Can we prove causality? One approach: look at neighborhoods where vibe suddenly improved (new subway line, Michelin-star restaurant opened) and use difference-in-differences to measure the causal price impact.

\textbf{5. Expansion to Other Cities and Countries.}
We analyzed London, Austin, and NYC (all English-speaking). Does vibe matter in Tokyo? Paris? Rio? Multi-language sentiment analysis could test cross-cultural generalization.

\textbf{6. Host Persona Segmentation.}
Not all hosts optimize for revenue. Some value flexibility. Some want stable income over max income. Cluster hosts by revealed preferences and tailor recommendations accordingly.

\textbf{7. A/B Testing in the Real World.}
Partner with hosts to run experiments: Group A follows our recommendations, Group B does not. Measure actual revenue differences over 6 months. This is the gold standard for validating our model.

\subsection{The Bottom Line}

We set out to answer one question: Does quantifying the subjective neighborhood vibe from guest reviews improve pricing recommendations?

The answer across three cities and 148,000 listings is a resounding yes. Vibe features contributed 31-33\% of model importance, often ranking as the \#1 feature. Revenue optimization revealed that 73-94\% of hosts are underpricing, leaving 47-74\% revenue on the table. The k-NN ``similar twins'' engine provides actionable price bands with tight ranges.

For academics, this proves that unstructured text data (reviews) can be transformed into economically meaningful features. For practitioners, this is a call to action: incorporate guest sentiment into your pricing strategy. For Airbnb and the PropTech industry, this is an opportunity to differentiate through better data use.

Hosts often ask, ``What should I charge?'' The standard answer has been, ``Look at similar listings.'' We improved that to, ``Look at similar high-demand listings in high-vibe neighborhoods, then optimize for the revenue-maximizing price while staying above 75\% occupancy.''

That is the difference between guesswork and data-driven decision making. And in a competitive market, that difference is worth tens of thousands of dollars per host per year.
