A few notes and things to fix: 

Amenities drop down: we need to clean up this list. I think by default we should have all amenities shown and assume the property has them all so they are all shown and the user can just click the "x" to get rid of the ones the property doesn't have. We need to clean up the list as well. I'm not sure what "Essentials" is or means, this needs to be more descriptive or if we have no context we need to figure out what it should be to make it more useful. I believe oven and stove are the same, so maybe we can combine them into Oven/Stove. 

Neighborhood Vibe Profile Chart: We need to change the labels of the circles to black or some other visible color as it is currently close to a white and the chart circle has a white background and this just isn't working. In the interactive part of the chart, as the user hovers over/near one of the data points and the stats pop up, lets edit the stat box so that the top line changes from "r:#.######" to "Score:#.#" where the score is rounded to the first decimal point only. The second line below needs to change to display just the dimension name where the score is being shown. In fact let's put the dimension name on the top line and the score below. 

Revenue Optimization: In this portion there is something going wrong as "Prediction error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/mnt/c/Users/Nicholas/adv_ba_project/data/london/models/knn_model.pkl'" was printed 50 times above the chart that got populated below. Maybe this is an artifact of the error, but each time I played around with this the plot was always just a straight line nightly price increases monthly revenue linearly with constant slope so it's super obvious to just max your nightly price to max monthly revenue in this case but the model must be wrong or if this is the case then there is no need to display this, as I think it then highlights one of the shortcomings of our model. 

Interactive Price Explorer: Something is wrong with the slider, as when I use it at all the page just resets completely. Also, another "Prediction error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/mnt/c/Users/Nicholas/adv_ba_project/data/london/models/knn_model.pkl'" is printed below the slider. For the chart and information above, I believe "pp" stands for percentage points but this may not be intuitive to the user so we either need to spell it out completely or use another term. In the final recommendations the XGBoost optimization seems ridiculously high (perhaps due to some error) and kind of makes our "Consider pricing in the range of [k-NN recommendation] - [XGBoost optimization]" kind of useless as the XGBoost portion is ridiculously high and unrealistic and creates a huge price range that is of no use to the user. 

Overall: let's get rid of the "GB" and "US" references as they are just clunky and not helpful. Instead, similar to how we have the statue of liberty emoji next to NYC, lets add maybe a UK/England flag emoji next to London, and find an appropriate emoji/figure to place next to Austin. Also, let's pre-populate the "Your Estimated Price" field with the average price based on the location and property type selected to help guide the user to a realistic estimate. Also, are the "Minimum Nights" and "Maximum Nights" fields necessary? Do they add any value or are used anywhere in the model(s)? If so, auto populate the minimum to 1 and maximum to 30 for more realistic starting points.
